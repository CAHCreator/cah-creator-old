A lightweight, collabor- you get it by now, right? Just [go to the website](http://cahcreator.com) and check it out.

## TODO

- [ ] User Creation
- [ ] Permanent Decks
- [ ] Deck Importing
- [ ] Clean up both serverside/clientside code

These should all be super easy, but it's usable right now so it's not super duper important! (plus, school sucks.)
